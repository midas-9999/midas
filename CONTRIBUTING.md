## Code of Conduct

Unicorn has adopted a Code of Conduct that we expect project participants to adhere to. Please [read the full text](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) so that you can understand what sort of behavior is expected.

## Our Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## Issues

[Open an issue](https://github.com/adamghill/django-unicorn/issues/new) **only** if you want to report a bug or a feature. Don't open issues for questions or support, instead create a [discussion](https://github.com/adamghill/django-unicorn/discussions/new) and ask there.

## Bug Reports and Feature Requests

Please use our issues templates that provide you with hints on what information we need from you to help you out.

## Pull Requests

Pull Requests are the best way to create a failing test case or sample code to replicate an issue.

## License

When you submit changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](https://github.com/adamghill/django-unicorn/blob/master/LICENSE) that covers the project.
