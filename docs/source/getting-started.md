# Getting Started

## Create a Django Project

Django `Unicorn` does not come bundled with `Django`, which means you will first need to have a working
Django project in order to take advantage of `Unicorn`. While it is recommended that you have some experience
working with Python and Django, below is a list of steps you would need to take in order to begin working with
Django `Unicorn`.

```{dropdown} Install the latest version of Python
Django `Unicorn will work with Python 3.8 or greater. But if you don't have Python installed, you will need to
download and install Python to your local machine.

You can find the [latest version](https://www.python.org/downloads/) of Python at [Python.org](https://www.python.org).

Once you have installed Python, make sure that it has been added to your PATH. You can check if it is in your path by opening
up a Terminal and checking for your version of Python.

`python --version`

```

```{dropdown} Create a virtual environment
does this work?

```{shell}
python -m venv .venv
```
```
